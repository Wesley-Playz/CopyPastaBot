<h1>Copypasta Bot 2.0 (LCPB2.0)</h1>
<p>This bot will send gifs (or words) everytime you say certain words. (You can either look at the code to see them all, or have fun and wait for it to happen on it's own).</p>
<p>This bot will also send a copypasta if you send the word Linux in any message.</p>
<p>The bot will ignore the following symbols and characters:</p>
<p>-_()*&$^!@${}[]||\\.,<>?`\"'~€ƒ‚„…†‡ˆ‰Š‹ŒŽ‘’“”•–—˜™š›œžŸ¡¢£¤¥¦§¨©ª«¬®¯°±²³´µ¶·¸¹º»¼½¾¿ÀÁÂÃÄÅÆÇÈÉÊËÌÍÎÏÐÑÒÓÔÕÖ×ØÙÚÛÜÝÞßàáâãäåæçèéêëìíîïðñòóôõö÷øùúûüýþÿ⟴:ロ‼️⁉️™️ℹ️↔️↕️</p>

<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>Edit the bot token in `secrets.json`.</p>
<p>Then run `npm install discord.js` in the folder with the `bot.js` and `secrets.json` files.</p>
<p>Then run `node bot.js` in the same folder. (I would recommend doing it in a screen session if you are running the bot on Linux).</p>
        

<h2>Here is the Linux copypasta in all of its glory:</h2>
<p>I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.\nMany computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called Linux, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.\nThere really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called Linux distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux!</p>
